<h3>Exercise 4 text</h3>
<p id="text1">Carol spent her weekend on holiday in Madrid. She went to see her
   old friend and found some time to go sightseeing. She saw some amazing sights.
    Luckily, she remembered to bring her camera with her so she took a lot of
    photos to show them to her colleagues. She took some time to buy souvenirs
    for her friends and decided to send a postcard to Paul, who is a postcard
    collector.</p>
