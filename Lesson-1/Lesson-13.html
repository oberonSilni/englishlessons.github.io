<h3>Exercise 4 text</h3>
<p id="text1">Carol and Paul finally had a day-off, so they sat down and looked
   at the photos Carol had taken on her business trip. Paul opened his photo
    editing software and started retouching, cropping, and resizing the photos.
     He edited the photo Carol took with the Chrysler Building to make it look
     like Carol is a giant holding the building in her hand. After the editing
     process, Carol's photos looked even better.</p>
