<h3>Exercise 4 text</h3>
<p id="text1">Carol wanted to learn how to play the guitar so Paul agreed to
  show her the ropes. First, Paul showed her how to hold the guitar and taught
   her a few chords. Carol loved the sound of the guitar and she was pretty
    excited to be able to make the sounds all by herself. Paul made Carol
     promise to practice every day what he had taught her, and in return he
     would teach her more.</p>
