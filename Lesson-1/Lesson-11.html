<h3>Exercise 4 text</h3>
<p id="text1">Carol and Paul are dreaming about nice weather,
  as it has been cold for several days. They are talking about what they
  like doing during the summertime. Paul usually spends time in nature whenever
  he has free time, and enjoys the greenery. He also likes hiking in the
   mountains. Carol spends most of her leisure time with her friends having
   picnics and going to the pool to cool off. They both agree that the summer
    is their favorite season.</p>
