<h3>Exercise 4 text</h3>
<p id="text1">After work one day, Carol and Paul were at the bar discussing
  their new boss. Carol thought that the new boss was not as good as their
  previous one. He seemed confused and less organized. Paul agreed,
  but added that the new boss might just need some time to learn the ropes.
  Finally, they agreed to have a few more drinks because in the future,
  they might not have time.</p>
